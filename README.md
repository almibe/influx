# influx
This project is a simple DSL for working with Xodus EntityStores' api.
It does not attempt to replace what can be done by directly working with the provided api.
Instead it focuses on allowing a simple command structure for adding and searching for entities.
This project is still very early in its development.
See `org.almibe.influx.InfluxSpec` in `src/test/kotlin` or issues for current status.
