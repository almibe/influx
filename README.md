# Wander

Wander is an experimental scripting language for working with knowledge graphs.
It is currently being developed as part of the Ligature project.
Wander tries to combine ideas from modern general purpose languages (mainly Kotlin, Scala, and Rust)
while focusing just on what's needed for working with knowledge graphs.

This project is an implementation of Wander for use with the Rust implementation of Ligature.
See [ligature](https://github.com/almibe/ligature) for the main project of the Rust implementation.
See [slonky](https://github.com/almibe/slonky) for the JVM implementation written in Kotlin.
See [ligature-specification](https://github.com/almibe/ligature-specification) to learn more about Ligature and Wander.

Status: This project isn't being worked on currently, since I am focusing on the JVM implementation first.
